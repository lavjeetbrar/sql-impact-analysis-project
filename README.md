# Donation Impact Analysis (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes donation data to identify:
- The highest-value assignments by donor type
- The highest-impact assignments within each region

The analysis demonstrates advanced SQL concepts including:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions (DENSE_RANK)
- Aggregation and filtering logic
- Business-driven query design

## Key Questions Answered
1. Which assignments receive the highest total donation amounts, segmented by donor type?
2. Which assignment has the highest impact score in each region, considering only funded assignments?

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (CTEs, window functions, joins)
- GitHub for version control

## Repository Structure
- `schema/` — table definitions
- `queries/` — final SQL solutions
- `results/` — exported outputs
- `notes/` — assumptions and design decisions

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data aggregation and ranking
- Analytical problem decomposition
- Writing production-ready SQL
- Clear documentation and communication
